# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Mark PulseBrief as being in Public Preview by adding a global footer note across the app.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a Public Preview note to the global footer with exactly: "PulseBrief is in public preview. Some features are limited. Pro (£19/month) coming soon."
- Keep the existing compliance disclaimer in the footer unchanged: "Informational only. Not financial advice."

**User-visible outcome:** Users see the Public Preview note in the footer on all pages where the footer appears (including the Landing page and authenticated app shell), while the existing compliance disclaimer remains unchanged.
