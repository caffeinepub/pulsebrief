Payment coming soon.”). Mark the existing deployed preview as “Public Preview” and add a footer note: “PulseBrief is in public preview. Some features are limited. Pro (£19/month) coming soon.”",

    "Design direction: dark, premium, minimal, high-trust fintech; emphasize scores and concise summaries; include simple chart placeholders",
    "Design principle update: emphasize clarity and speed over detail (especially on Today Brief).",
    "Standardize score component UI across pages: consistent layout and copy pattern (value, label, one-sentence rationale).",
    "Avoid complex charts; prioritize clear summaries and minimal visualizations.",
    "Sign-in/Profile UX must never be a dead-end: provide an explicit exit path back to home and allow modal dismissal (outside click/ESC) if implemented as a modal.",
    "Header PulseBrief logo should be a consistent global navigation element that always returns to the home screen.",
    "Copy update: Today Brief primary headline label should be “Today’s Market Pulse” (replacing prior “What matters today”)."
